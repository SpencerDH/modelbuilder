# Overview

AS OF RIGHT NOW, THE PACKAGE HAS BASIC FUNCTIONALITY, BUT HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY TESTED AND DEBUGGED YET!

The modelbuilder package allows users to build and analyze mechanistic, compartmental dynamicl systems models, encoded as ODEs, discrete time, or stochastic models. 

This is a very early version of the package, only some features are already implemented.

See the "Get Started" section on the [Github Pages Site](https://ahgroup.github.io/modelbuilder/) for a basic and currently sparse introduction.
