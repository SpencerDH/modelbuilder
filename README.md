# Overview

AS OF RIGHT NOW, THE PACKAGE IS NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL YET!

The modelbuilder package allows users to build and analyze mechanistic, compartmental dynamicl systems models, encoded as ODEs, discrete time, or stochastic models. 

This is a very early release of the package, only some features are already implemented.

See the "Get Started" section for a basic (currently sparse) introduction.
